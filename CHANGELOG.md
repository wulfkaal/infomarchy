# Changelog

All notable changes to Infomarchy. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Automatic topic refinement can be switched off, because the loopback test cannot see an SSH forward.** Refinement is gated on `OLLAMA_HOST` being loopback, but that test reads the address rather than the destination: an `ssh -L 11434:localhost:11434` forward answers on `127.0.0.1`, passes the check, and refinement then posts prompt text to another machine. A forward is indistinguishable from a local socket by address, so this does not make the check smarter — `INFOMARCHY_SKIP_REFINEMENT=1` disables automatic refinement outright, checked before both the loopback test and the explicit `INFOMARCHY_ALLOW_REMOTE_OLLAMA` opt-in. Scope is refinement only: inventory polling and explicit LOAD/UNLOAD are unchanged, the latter posting an empty prompt to set model residency rather than session text. Set it in the shell's own environment and restart the shell, since the collectors inherit theirs at launch. It also suits anyone who simply wants a desk that does not refine on its own, on a metered link or a shared box.

## [1.1.3] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **The version on the desk tracks the manifest.** `omarchy plugin update` rewrites `manifest.json` under a running shell, and the About panel read it once at load — so after an in-place update the desk went on reporting the version it started with, which is the one number that must never be stale. The manifest is watched now.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-09-07

### Changed
- **A video wallpaper is whatever Omarchy says it is.** Both surfaces asked a literal extension list of their own, so a format added to Omarchy's `Util.isVideoPath` would have left the desk blank here until Infomarchy was changed to match. They now defer to `Util.isVideoPath` when the running Omarchy has it, and fall back to the list only where it does not — calling a function that is not there would take the plugin down on exactly the older desktops the fallback exists for.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-09-07

### Fixed
- **Video wallpapers show.** Infomarchy hosts the background layer in place of `omarchy.background`, and drew the wallpaper with a plain `Image`. Omarchy's video wallpapers (quattro) therefore arrived as `Error decoding: ... Unsupported image format` and left the desk on the flat theme colour — selecting one looked like the picker had done nothing. Stills and videos are now handed to separate surfaces, and a video goes to Omarchy's own `BackgroundMedia`, reached through a Loader by URL so an Omarchy without video support never resolves the type and keeps the still path exactly as it was. Playback stops while a fullscreen window covers that output, since Qt's FFmpeg engine drives its own clock and an unseen wallpaper otherwise decodes on. The SUPER+D overlay had the same blank and is fixed with it, and decodes only while it is open.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-07

### Added
- **GITHUB · LAST 7 DAYS.** The activity row is now two half-width cards: the AI prompt heatmap on the left and, on the right, the same hour-by-hour grid fed from GitHub — commits, PRs, reviews, issues, comments and other events, coloured by dominant kind, hover for the breakdown and the repositories, today/week counts in the header. Click pins a cell; a legend kind recolours the grid to that kind alone. It is a removable module (**4** in the overlay; the modules after it shift one key and **0** reaches the tenth) and either card takes the full row when the other is hidden.
- **ABOUT.** The version sits at the quiet end of the legend line under the last card — on screen always, never in the way of the data. Clicking it opens ABOUT: the version, a link to the repository, and a link to nixfred.com. The version is read from `manifest.json` at load, so it cannot drift from the version the plugin actually ships as, and `openUrl` refuses any address other than those two. Esc closes ABOUT before it closes the desk.
- **Grok Bot gets a card per bot.** The xAI desktop app runs its whole roster inside one Electron process, so `/proc` can only ever show one agent. Infomarchy reads the app's own local roster (`~/.config/Grok Bot/sand-client-persistence`, one plain-JSON file per state slice, named by the base32 of its key) and expands it into one **Live AI session** card per bot: the bot's name, the last line it wrote (markdown flattened, secrets redacted the same way prompts are), and its **Needs You** state — *waiting for your answer*, or *has replies you have not read* with the count on the card. Hidden-from-sidebar bots get no card, and transcripts are never opened. Because the bots share one process, its CPU/RAM/GPU counters are attributed once — to the bot the app currently has open — and the other cards report `—` rather than repeating the same process nine times. The alert key omits the unread count, so a bot notifies when it goes unread, not again on every further reply.
- **Grok Bot is detected at all.** Electron rewrites its process title, so the whole command line arrives as a single `argv[0]` — and the install path itself contains a space. The browser process is now matched on that line, while the zygote/renderer/gpu/utility helpers (`--type=`) and the `local-exec-daemon` script are not.
- **Grok CLI sessions are counted from disk.** Grok ≥ 1.0 gives every session its own directory under the encoded cwd, so sessions that have not been prompted yet were invisible. `GROK_HOME` is honoured, and a project path too long to encode is read back from the group's `.cwd` file instead of showing as a slug plus a hash.
- `github-activity.ts`: commits from `gh api search/commits` by author date (one row per commit, default branches only), everything else from the user's own events feed; both slimmed by `gh --jq` so no commit message or issue body is ever parsed. A private `github-activity.json` store, written by the wallpaper collector and read by the overlay, fills the week incrementally (one step a minute until covered, then every five minutes, at most a handful of calls per step), pages the events feed until a known id, walks one search query page by page so timestamp ties cannot stall it, re-walks the window every six hours for late-indexed commits, backs off on failures, resets on an account change, and survives restarts and dropped connections as a *stale* grid. `INFOMARCHY_SKIP_GITHUB=1` disables it.

### Changed
- A live Grok card now resolves its own session id from the session files the CLI holds open, instead of inferring one from the project's prompt history.
- Session cards and the inspector print `—` for a resource counter that is genuinely unavailable, rather than `0B` / `0 proc`.
- The heatmap canvas, tooltip and legend are one `HeatPanel` component used by both cards. Card header hints now elide instead of pushing past a half-width card.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-05

1.0 marks the desk as complete for daily use: every card reaches its session (terminal, Herdr, tmux, Boomux or a Claude background job), the whole desk fits a 1920×1080 screen with nothing clipped or running off the edge, and the layout is instrumented so future fixes are measured rather than guessed.

### Added
- **Every Claude card reaches its session.** Claude Code's own registry (`claude agents --json`) is merged by pid: exact job ids on Herdr-hosted sessions, session names on cards, busy state from the registry, `blocked` shown as waiting. Background sessions open with `claude attach <id>` in a terminal. The `claude daemon run` supervisor is no longer mistaken for a session (the phantom "Improving Pi" card).
- **Zombie sessions.** A session that is unattended (background, or no window and nothing attachable), not busy and idle for six hours gets a **STALE · idle Nh** tag. The inspector offers **STOP SESSION** (`claude stop <id>`, transcript kept) and **END PROCESS** (SIGTERM, only if the pid's start time and agent argv still match the card). Two clicks, four-second arm window, never automatic.
- **SUPER+I / SUPER+D legend.** Header hints in the overlay; one quiet line under the MACHINE card on the wallpaper.
- `omarchy-shell infomarchy geometry` — the settled layout widths (view, columns, LOCAL AI card/body/rows/tag/meter and each row's implicit width) as JSON. Read it before touching a layout constant.

### Changed
- **The desk fits 1080p end to end.** MACHINE is a two-column grid (CPU|RAM, DISK|WIFI) with a one-line footer (WAN · LAN / rates · ping · BAT); sessions sit on one row; ops cards are content-sized; RECENT TASKS keeps a minimum height; LOCAL AI rows share one action column with fixed arrow and action slots; Meter values elide instead of pushing; both columns are fractions of the view width, never constants.

### Fixed
- **SUPER+D shows the real desktop** (theme background behind the wallpaper) and **SUPER+I applies inside the overlay** as well as on the wallpaper. SUPER+D then SUPER+I now does what it says.
- **LOCAL AI pills lost their right border.** The provider-chips row was a `RowLayout` of rigid tags whose minimum (514 px) exceeded the card body (512 px); the column then laid every row out 2 px past the clip, cutting the right edge of LOAD/UNLOAD and the GPU bar. The chips are now a `Flow` (no minimum; wraps if labels grow). Found by measuring, not guessing: new `omarchy-shell infomarchy geometry` IPC reports the settled layout widths.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-09-05

### Added
- **7-day token trend** in USAGE & LIMITS: one line per provider, tokens per day, hover for exact figures, with a **TOKENS / ≈ $ VALUE** toggle. Per-provider rows show today's and lifetime *estimated API value*, cache-read share and session count. Fed entirely from Omarchy's Agents usage cache — no new scanning. Prices from a pinned, attributed LiteLLM snapshot (`pricing.json`, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`); unknown models are shown as unpriced, never guessed.
- **Clicking a card jumps inside the multiplexer.** Herdr: the agent descends from `herdr server`, so the client terminal is found through the Herdr client process and the pane is focused over Herdr's socket API (`workspace.focus → tab.focus → pane.focus`, bundled `herdr-focus.ts`). tmux: `select-window`, `select-pane`, `switch-client`. Boomux: window matched via the `__attach` client or Boomux's own window title, then `boomux open <shell-id> --workspace <name>` (verified on 1.9.7).
- Sessions running under Claude Code's background daemon (`bg-pty-host`) are labelled **background · claude daemon** and dimmed instead of looking like a duplicate of the interactive session in the same repository.

### Fixed
- Attention rows and the inspector's FOCUS use the multiplexer-aware path.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-09-05

Marketplace security-review follow-up (omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace#2931).

### Changed
- Subprocess deadlines are firm: SIGTERM, a 250 ms grace period, SIGKILL if still alive, then reaped — in the collector and in every window-preview stage.
- Successful preview artifacts are deleted with an ownership check when a preview is replaced, when previews are disabled, when the session's window is gone, and when the view is destroyed; the stale sweep is capped at 32 removals per run.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-05

First marketplace release with the operations desk. Verified on a stock Omarchy 4.0.2 VM (fresh install, no bun → install hint → `pacman -S bun` → desk fills in without a restart), and by two independent Codex reviews (gpt-5.6-sol and gpt-6-astra) whose 60+ confirmed findings were each reproduced before being fixed.

### Added
- **Operations desk**: WHAT CHANGED (per-repository working-tree summary with seen/unseen tracking), NEXT ACTIONS (specific blocked / waiting / review signals with one-click ANSWER / RESOLVE / REVIEW / RESUME), PROJECT HEALTH (branch, dirty state, ahead/behind, last commit, newest GitHub Actions run via authenticated `gh`, click to filter the whole dashboard). All three are draggable and individually removable.
- **Proactive alerts** through Omarchy's notification service: blocked, waiting, ready-for-review, ended, and title-reported crashes; persistent seven-day deduplication with episode tracking; global switch, per-provider mutes, and quiet hours (22:00–08:00). Clicking an alert opens the fullscreen desk.
- **Multiplexer-hosted sessions**: agents inside Herdr, Boomux, or tmux stay visible with their bounded host identity; an attached tmux pane focuses its real client terminal and switches the client to that pane.
- **Ollama controls**: pick any installed model, LOAD (pinned) / UNLOAD per loaded row, size-aware CONFIRM for large models.
- **Hermes** (NousResearch) detected as a provider.
- Session inspector (right-click a card): move to workspace, focus, open a terminal in the project, toggle hover previews.
- Prompt search, pinning, and per-cell heatmap drill-down; recent rows shipped up to 1,000 for a full week.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, and a `bun` install step in the README (Omarchy does not ship bun).

### Changed
- Collector output is one awaited write; snapshots are capped at 960 KiB, below the shell-side limit, so a valid frame can never be rejected.
- Every external JSON source (histories, usage caches, Ollama, hyprctl, gh) is parsed through one bounded, coercion-safe path; malformed or hostile content degrades a single card, never the desk.
- Automatic topic refinement talks only to a loopback Ollama unless `INFOMARCHY_ALLOW_REMOTE_OLLAMA=1` is set — prompt text does not leave the machine by default.
- Demo mode now covers the SUPER+D overlay as well as the wallpaper.
- Credential redaction covers env-style assignments, credentials in URLs, PEM blocks, JWTs, and common cloud key shapes (best effort).
- Provider detection matches the executable only (or a script run by a known interpreter): `cat /tmp/claude` is no longer an agent.
- Attention signals are evaluated only for idle agents; a title that mentions "permission" or "failed" mid-task no longer alerts.
- The collector keeps running at a quarter cadence while the desk is hidden so alerts still arrive; it stops entirely only when alerts are off too.
- Throughput is displayed in bits/s; COPY PROMPT is now COPY EXCERPT (140-character redacted excerpt).

### Fixed
- Desk went blank on: a `%` in a Grok session directory name, a non-array `active_sessions.json`, a nested object in a Grok pid, a null entry from `hyprctl clients`, `{"toString":0}` anywhere in external JSON, two large usage caches, and a `history.jsonl` over 8 MB (Claude then showed as "not installed"). All degrade gracefully now.
- Desk froze when a killed helper left a child holding its pipe (`gh` → `git`, shell → `sleep`); the collector now abandons the pipe at its deadline and exits explicitly.
- Ollama LOAD / UNLOAD never completed (helper waited for stdin EOF that Quickshell never sends).
- Topic refinement cached its own timeouts as summaries and never retried; Codex rows had no project and RESUME opened `$HOME`; pinned prompts vanished past 80 rows; quiet-hours and muted alerts were marked delivered and never shown; the first snapshot after a restart dropped ended-session events.
- Display escaping corrupted paths and clipboard text (`~/R&D` → `~/R＆D`); `/home/pi2` was treated as inside `/home/pi`; Git paths with non-ASCII characters were shown as octal escapes.
- Session inference could bind a live agent to a later session's prompts or steal an id another live agent owned.
- Resource leaks: preview temp directories, orphaned state temp files, unbounded topic/pin/mute/seen maps, per-tick full scans of `opencode.db`, unbounded git/gh/Ollama fan-out, rollout enumeration past the cap.
- Inspector drawer froze on stale data; the wallpaper search box could never receive keystrokes; busy/attention animations ran while hidden; garbage `nvidia-smi` / `df` / `ping` output rendered as an empty GPU, a null disk, or a QML binding error.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-08-28

- Four live session cards per row; clipboard and preview helper hardening.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-27

- First marketplace-hardened build: live AI sessions, 7-day heatmap, recent tasks, usage limits, local AI, machine telemetry, SUPER+D overlay, SUPER+I toggle.
