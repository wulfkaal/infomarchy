## Why

You run Claude Code in three terminals, Codex in a fourth, Grok is poking at a repo somewhere, Ollama is warming a model, and your weekly limit is quietly at 86%. The only way to know any of that is to go *look* — tab through windows, read titles, run `nvidia-smi`, open a dashboard.

Infomarchy puts all of it on the one surface you always have open and never use: **the wallpaper.** It's not a widget in the bar and not another window to manage. It's the desk itself, and it's always current.

## What you get

<td width="62%" valign="top">

### 🟡 Live AI sessions — *who is working right now*

<img src="docs/sessions.png" alt="Live AI sessions card">

One card per running agent — **Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Grok Bot, Gemini, Hermes, opencode, aider, Ollama chats** — detected straight from `/proc`, no agent-side hooks, nothing to configure. Each card shows the project, working directory, how long it's been up, the pid, the workspace it lives on, and the terminal's own title. Its two-line **current topic** is a short synopsis derived from several exact-session requests—not the last prompt copied onto the card. A loaded local Ollama model may refine the wording; summaries are cached by session/content and Infomarchy never auto-loads a model. The dot **pulses while the agent is thinking**.

**Zombies.** A session nobody is attached to (background, or no window and nothing to attach to) that is not busy and has had no prompt for six hours gets a **STALE · idle Nh** tag on its card. Right-click it: a background Claude session offers **STOP SESSION** (`claude stop <id>` — graceful, the conversation stays resumable), anything else stale offers **END PROCESS** (SIGTERM, only after the helper re-verifies the pid still belongs to the process the card described). Both need a second confirming click within four seconds; nothing is ever stopped automatically. Claude Code's own registry (`claude agents --json`, consulted only when its daemon is already running) supplies exact session ids, display names and live busy/blocked state for every running Claude, and marks **background** sessions — the ones started with `--bg` or living under the daemon — whose cards open a terminal attached to the running session (`claude attach <id>`). Agents hosted inside **Herdr, Boomux, or tmux** remain visible. Their large session card reports the host and its bounded identity: Herdr workspace/tab/pane, Boomux workspace/shell plus exact shell/run IDs in the snapshot, or tmux `session:window.pane`. Infomarchy reads only those documented identity variables from the agent environment; unrelated environment values are never serialized. An attached tmux pane is matched to its client terminal, and a Herdr-hosted agent to the terminal running the Herdr client (the agent descends from `herdr server`, a daemon, so plain process ancestry never reaches the window). **Clicking the card focuses that terminal and then jumps inside the multiplexer**: `tmux select-window` / `select-pane` / `switch-client` for tmux, `workspace.focus` / `tab.focus` / `pane.focus` over Herdr's socket API for Herdr (its CLI only exposes a *directional* pane focus), via the bundled `herdr-focus.ts`, each id validated and the socket taken from the agent's own environment. For Boomux the window is matched through the `boomux __attach <shell-id>` client process, or the terminal title Boomux sets (`boomux:shell:<node>:<shell-id> | workspace - name`); the jump focuses that window and runs `boomux open <shell-id> --workspace <workspace-name>`, which shows the Workspace layer and re-focuses the existing terminal (verified against Boomux 1.9.7: no duplicate window; a bare `open` neither moves focus nor duplicates). A shell created from inside Herdr inherits Herdr's variables, so Boomux is resolved first and the inherited Herdr host is dropped. A host with no client window at all shows **no client window found** rather than guessing one. Remote-only processes on another machine are outside local `/proc` and are not fabricated.

**Grok Bot.** The xAI desktop app runs every bot in its roster inside one Electron process, so `/proc` shows a single agent no matter how many bots you have. Infomarchy reads the app's own local roster — `~/.config/Grok Bot/sand-client-persistence`, one plain-JSON file per state slice, each named by the base32 of its key — and gives **each bot its own card**: its name, the last line it wrote (markdown flattened, secrets redacted like any other prompt), and whether it is waiting on your answer or holding replies you have not read. Bots you hid from the sidebar get no card, and transcripts are never opened. Since the bots share one process, its CPU/RAM/GPU counters are attributed once, to the bot the app currently has open; the other cards show `—` rather than repeating the same process on every card. Clicking any of them focuses the Grok Bot window.

Each card also attributes live CPU, resident RAM, process-tree size, and—when `nvidia-smi` exposes compute PIDs—GPU memory to that agent. The detailed totals repeat in the inspector; unavailable counters display `—`.

Only the full per-session cards appear in Live AI Sessions; there is no duplicate compact workspace-card strip. Each large card includes its workspace number. In the session inspector, workspace buttons 1–10 can move that exact agent window silently; the current workspace is highlighted and disabled.

Window thumbnails are opt-in: right-click a large session card, toggle **PREVIEWS OFF/ON** in its inspector, then hover a live card. Infomarchy captures only that exact address after a short delay, downsizes it to 160×90, applies a heavy blur, and displays a 320×180 still. The raw capture moves through bounded in-memory streams from `grim` to ImageMagick without touching disk; the blurred result is written through an exclusive no-follow descriptor inside a random private temporary directory.

Cards also show the repository branch, clean/changed state, ahead/behind counts, and merge conflicts. A **Needs You** strip calls out agents that appear blocked, waiting for input, or finished for review, plus repositories being shared by multiple live agents.

Active Needs You signals get a faint breathing outline (the module chip glows too if the card is removed). Click the signal to focus it, **10M** to snooze it for ten minutes, or **×** to dismiss that signal for the lifetime of its process. Snoozes and dismissals persist between the wallpaper and fullscreen overlay.

The card's alert controls send deduplicated Omarchy notifications when an agent is blocked, waiting for an answer, ready for review, or ends — and, when the terminal title says so, when it has crashed (Infomarchy reads titles and `/proc`; it has no exit-status feed, so a silent segfault reports as an ended session). A signal that clears and later fires again is a new episode and notifies again. Alerts are enabled globally by default; each currently active provider can be muted independently, and **QUIET 22–08** suppresses overnight delivery. Event fingerprints persist for seven days, so restarting the shell never replays old alerts. A disappeared session must be absent from two consecutive polls before Infomarchy reports that it ended. Clicking an alert opens the fullscreen desk.

**Click a Needs You signal → jump straight to that agent's terminal.** From the fullscreen overlay, Infomarchy closes itself after focusing the session.

**Click a card → Infomarchy focuses the terminal window hosting that agent.** It walks the process tree up to the Hyprland client, so it works through `kitty`, `alacritty`, `ghostty`, tmux, whatever.

**Right-click a card → inspect it in place.** The centered inspector shows its window, shortened session identity, workspace, uptime, pid, and repository state. From there you can focus the existing window or open a fresh terminal in the project directory; paths are passed as process arguments, never evaluated as shell text.

### 🟢 Usage & limits — *what it's costing you*

<img src="docs/usage.png" alt="Usage and limits card">

Above the limit meters sits a **7-day trend**: one line per provider, tokens processed per day, three gridlines, hover any day for the exact figures. The **TOKENS / ≈ $ VALUE** chip switches the same lines to an *estimated API value* — what those tokens would have cost at published API prices — and each provider row shows today's and lifetime estimates, the share of lifetime tokens that were cache reads, and the session count. Prices come from a pinned, attributed LiteLLM snapshot (`pricing.json`, see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`); models missing from it are shown as *unpriced* rather than guessed, and the estimate is never your subscription bill. All of it is read from the `omarchy.agents` usage cache — no new scanning.

Session (5-hour) and weekly (7-day) rate-limit meters with time-to-reset, today's prompt count and token volume, per subscription. Meters turn **yellow past 60%** and **red past 85%**, in your theme's yellow and red.

Provider chips filter the card interactively. Toggle **PERCENT / FORECAST** to project each recognized 5-hour or 7-day meter to reset from its elapsed-window pace; young or malformed windows say `learning` instead of showing a misleading number.

Infomarchy reuses the cache that Omarchy's own `omarchy.agents` bar widget maintains — enable that widget once and this card lights up. No extra logins, no API keys.

### 🟢 Local AI

Ollama up/down, every **loaded** model with its VRAM, GPU utilisation / memory / temperature, and lifetime totals per provider. Arrow controls select any locally installed model and show its parameter count, quantization, and disk size. **LOAD** pins the selected model in memory; each loaded row has its own **UNLOAD** action. Models at least 8 GiB—or larger than currently available accelerator/system memory—require a second **CONFIRM** click.

Model changes go through a bounded stdin-framed helper. It validates the model name against Ollama's live `/api/tags` or `/api/ps` inventory before using the documented empty `/api/generate` request with `keep_alive: -1` (load) or `0` (unload). Infomarchy never pulls, deletes, or auto-loads a model.

### 🟡 Activity · last 7 days — *when you actually work*

<img src="docs/heatmap.png" alt="7-day hourly activity heatmap">

An hour-by-hour heatmap of prompts across **every** provider, newest day at the bottom, with a red tick at *now*. The dominant provider colours each cell; intensity is volume. Cells are local wall-clock hours, so on the two DST nights a year one hour is doubled up (fall) or absent (spring). Hover a cell for the exact breakdown (*"Tue 18 Aug 16:00 · 8 prompts (Claude 6, Codex 2)"*). Click an hour to filter Recent Tasks to that hour; click a provider in the legend to combine a provider filter. The selected cell and provider stay outlined, and clicking either again—or **clear**—removes that part of the filter. The header carries today/week counts per provider.

### 🟢 GitHub · last 7 days — *what actually landed*

The right half of the same row is the identical grid fed from GitHub: **commits, PRs, reviews, issues, comments** and everything else (releases, forks, stars, branch creates) as *other*, each cell coloured by its dominant kind, the same red tick at *now*. Hover a cell for the breakdown plus the repositories involved (*"Fri 4 Sep 23:00 · 9 events · commits 7 · PRs 2 · infomarchy, blip"*). The header carries today/week counts per kind. There is no list to filter here, so a click **pins** a cell (its breakdown stays in the status line) and clicking a kind in the legend recolours the grid to that kind alone; **clear** or the overlay's **A** key resets both. In the overlay the module answers to key **4** (ACTIVITY is 3; the modules after it shift by one and **0** reaches the tenth).

Data comes through the already-authenticated GitHub CLI (`gh`), nothing else: commits from `search/commits` by author date (one row per commit, default branches only — a push to a feature branch shows once it lands), everything else from your own events feed, private repositories included. GitHub caps a search at 1000 rows and 30 calls a minute, so the week is filled in incrementally — one step a minute until the oldest day is covered (the status line says *filling in older days* meanwhile), then a five-minute refresh. Rows are cached in a private state file written by the wallpaper collector and read by the overlay, so a restart or a dropped connection shows the cached grid rather than an empty card — marked *stale* once fetches have been failing for fifteen minutes, with retries backing off to five minutes. Every six hours the week is walked again so a commit merged days after it was authored still lands in its hour. Switching `gh` accounts starts the store over. Without `gh`, or before `gh auth login`, the card says exactly that. `INFOMARCHY_SKIP_GITHUB=1` in the collector's environment disables the fetch entirely. Remove either card from the module strip and the other takes the full row.

### ⚪ Recent tasks — *what got asked*

The newest prompts across all providers — time ago, provider tag, project, and the prompt itself — so the question *"what was I doing an hour ago?"* has an answer on the wall. The list keeps up to 80 rows in a scrollable history, with a search box that matches prompt text, project, or provider (filtered searches can show up to 200 matches). Prompts whose exact agent session is still running stay bright and clickable; click one to jump to its terminal. Supported closed sessions are dimmed but remain interactive: hover for **RESUME**, then click to reopen that exact Claude, Codex, Grok, or OpenCode session in a terminal at its project directory.

Right-click a prompt for its action drawer: copy, pin/unpin, open the project, and review up to five recent prompts from the same session. Pins persist and sort above ordinary recency without changing the underlying history. Wheel and touchpad deltas are handled directly by the row beneath the pointer, and the wider scrollbar track can be clicked or dragged.

### 🔵 Operations intelligence — *what changed, what needs you, what is healthy*

Three compact cards sit beneath the live sessions:

- **What Changed** fingerprints each active repository and highlights it until you inspect the newest state. It summarizes staged, untracked, test, addition/deletion, and commit data; expand a row to copy changed paths or open the project.
- **Next Actions** turns terminal state into a short reason and an exact control: **Answer**, **Resolve**, **Review**, **Resume**, or **Open Project**. Permission/approval prompts, conflicts, failures, questions, and completed work no longer share one vague warning.
- **Project Health** combines live agent count, branch, clean/dirty state, ahead/behind and conflicts, the last commit, and the newest GitHub Actions result when authenticated `gh` is available. Click a repository to filter sessions, prompts, changes, and action signals across the whole dashboard; click the project chip at the top to clear it.

All three cards are independently removable. Drag their headers left or right to reorder them; they snap into place and the order persists. The layout compacts automatically when one or two cards are hidden.

### 🟢🟡🔵 Machine — *the boring numbers, in the corner where they belong*

<img src="docs/machine.png" alt="Machine stats card">

| Meter | Colour | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU** | theme blue | % busy, 1-min load, hottest thermal zone |
| **RAM** | theme **green** | used / total, % |
| **Disk** | theme **yellow** | used / total per mount (btrfs subvolume twins collapsed) |
| **Wi-Fi** | theme **green** | SSID, signal in dBm (bar = link quality), IPv4 |
| **WAN** | theme cyan | cached external IPv4/IPv6 |
| **↓ ↑ throughput** | green | **real-time** bits/s (Kb/Mb/Gb) on the default route interface, wired or wireless |
| **⇄ latency** | green / yellow / red | live **ping to Cloudflare 1.1.1.1** — red on timeout |
| **Battery** | — | % and charging state, hidden on desktops |

Any meter goes **red** when it's genuinely in trouble (RAM > 90%, disk > 90%, CPU > 85%, ping dead).

The three right-column cards—Usage, Local AI, and Machine—also have draggable headers. Drag one far enough up or down to swap it with its neighbor; the card snaps into place and the order persists across overlay and shell restarts. Every section can still be removed and restored from the module strip.

### ⌨️ Two surfaces, one dashboard

The wallpaper is interactive wherever no window covers it (double-click or right-click the empty desk opens Omarchy's wallpaper switcher, as stock does). Press **`SUPER + I`** to hide the wallpaper dashboard and see the clean desktop; press it again to restore the cards. When you're buried in terminals, **`SUPER + D`** shows the desktop on top of everything — the wallpaper exactly as the desk paints it, with the dashboard when SUPER+I has it visible and the plain photo when it doesn't; `Esc` or a click on the backdrop dismisses it.

The module strip doubles as a keyboard command strip in the overlay: **1–9** toggle modules, **J/K** (or arrows) select a live session, **Enter** focuses it, **A** clears activity filters, and **Esc** closes. The selected session gets a bright outline.

## Install

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed bun   # the collector runs on bun; Omarchy does not ship it
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/nixfred/infomarchy.git --enable --yes
omarchy restart shell    # first time only: services load at shell start
```

If bun is missing the desk says so in red at the top and in the sessions card, and fills in on the next refresh after you install it — no restart needed.

The plugin declares itself as a clone of `omarchy.background`, so Omarchy hands it the wallpaper role. Your chosen wallpaper is still there — dimmed to 32% behind the glass — and `omarchy theme bg set …` keeps working.

Bind the fullscreen overlay and wallpaper-dashboard toggle in `~/.config/hypr/bindings.lua` (pick any free chords):

```lua
o.bind("SUPER + D", "Infomarchy: AI info desk", "omarchy-shell shell toggle nixfred.infomarchy '{}'")
-- Hide the cards to see the plain desktop; press again to restore them.
o.bind("SUPER + I", "Infomarchy: toggle wallpaper dashboard", "omarchy-shell infomarchy toggleDashboard")
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nixfred/infomarchy.git ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/nixfred.infomarchy
omarchy-shell shell rescanPlugins
omarchy plugin enable nixfred.infomarchy
omarchy restart shell
```
</details>

## Remove

Remove Infomarchy and return to the stock wallpaper service with:

```bash
omarchy plugin remove nixfred.infomarchy --yes
omarchy restart shell
```

## Requirements

Omarchy Quattro with third-party shell plugin support, `bun` (**not** part of the Omarchy base install — `sudo pacman -S bun`), `iw`, `iproute2`, and `ping`. Optional: `nvidia-smi` (GPU row hides without it), authenticated GitHub CLI `gh` (for the latest CI result and the GITHUB heatmap), the `omarchy.agents` bar widget (for the usage card), Ollama (for the local-AI card), and Herdr/Boomux/tmux when those hosts are actually used. Infomarchy does not start or configure a multiplexer. Hyprland 0.56+ (Lua dispatch) and older (`focuswindow`) are both handled.

## It follows your theme

There are no colours in this plugin. Infomarchy reads the active theme's `colors.toml` — `green`, `yellow`, `red`, `blue`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `foreground`, `background` — and falls back to Omarchy's `Color` singleton for anything a theme leaves out. Fonts and spacing come from Omarchy's `Style`, so `omarchy display text size` scales the desk too. Switch themes and the desk re-skins in place.

The screenshots above are the **Last Call** theme. A theme gallery is on the roadmap — PRs with your theme's screenshot are very welcome.

```

- **`collector.ts`** builds one snapshot. It reads `argv` for every pid (cheap), then lazily opens only agent processes and their ancestors, so a 1 000-process box costs ~0.2 s warm. Local files are opened once with no-follow/nonblocking semantics, must be regular files, and are read under byte/time limits. Rate baselines use private, atomic state files under `$XDG_STATE_HOME/infomarchy/prev-<instance>.json`. It never parses the multi-hundred-MB Claude/Codex session transcripts — only the small history/index files and OpenCode's local SQLite history.
- **`github-activity.ts`** keeps the 7-day GitHub row store: incremental `search/commits` and events fetches through `gh`, keyed by sha and event id, pruned to the window, turned into the same 7×24 cells as the prompt heatmap.
- **`resume-session.ts`** maps each supported provider to its installed CLI resume syntax and launches it through `xdg-terminal-exec`. Provider, ID, and project are separate process arguments; prompt text is never executed.
- **`ollama-control.ts`** accepts one bounded JSON frame over stdin, validates the requested model against Ollama's inventory, and performs only explicit load/unload operations.
- **`notification-events.ts`** derives bounded, stable attention and lifecycle events. The background service sends them through Omarchy's notification interface after persistent deduplication; the overlay never sends a duplicate copy.
- **`InfoModel.qml`** owns the timer, the parse, the theme colours, and helpers (`focusWindow`, formatting).
- **`InfoView.qml`** is pure presentation, hosted twice: on the **background** layer by `Infomarchy.qml`, and on the **overlay** layer by `Overlay.qml`. The background host keeps the `background` IPC target so Omarchy's wallpaper tooling is unaffected.

### Portable by design

No usernames, hostnames or absolute paths are hardcoded anywhere. The collector honours `HOME`, `XDG_STATE_HOME`, `XDG_DATA_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `CODEX_HOME` and `OLLAMA_HOST`; every source is optional and degrades to "not present" rather than failing. If you don't use Grok or OpenCode, its tag just never appears.

## Data handling

Prompt and session data stays on the machine, with the one documented exception of automatic topic refinement described below. Prompt text is stored as a 140-character redacted excerpt; the drawer's COPY EXCERPT and the search box operate on that excerpt, not the full prompt. Network checks are limited to the existing ping to `1.1.1.1`, the Ollama API, a Cloudflare trace request for the public IP at most once every 15 minutes per dashboard surface, and—only when authenticated `gh` is installed—the newest GitHub Actions run for each active repository, cached for ten minutes. Automatic topic refinement sends recent prompt text to Ollama only when `OLLAMA_HOST` is loopback; pointing it at another machine disables refinement unless you set `INFOMARCHY_ALLOW_REMOTE_OLLAMA=1` in the shell's environment, because that is prompt text leaving the machine. **That test reads the address, not the destination:** an SSH port forward to a remote Ollama answers on `127.0.0.1`, passes the check, and refinement then posts prompt text off the machine. A forward cannot be told from a local socket by its address, so the remedy is a switch rather than a smarter test — set `INFOMARCHY_SKIP_REFINEMENT=1` to disable automatic refinement outright, checked before both the loopback test and the opt-in. That check reads the address and not the destination, so an SSH port forward to a remote Ollama answers on loopback and passes it. Set `INFOMARCHY_SKIP_REFINEMENT=1` to refuse automatic refinement outright — it is checked before both the loopback test and the opt-in. It must be in the environment of the running shell, not merely exported in a terminal: the wallpaper and overlay collectors inherit their environment at launch, so restart the shell to apply it, and it does not cancel a request already in flight. It governs automatic refinement only; inventory checks and explicit LOAD/UNLOAD still reach Ollama, the latter with an empty prompt to set model residency. Explicit LOAD/UNLOAD clicks still target whatever host you configured. Ollama state changes happen only after an explicit card action and can only load or unload a model already present in the corresponding local inventory. Notifications are sent to the local Omarchy notification service; no session data is relayed to a remote notification provider. Multiplexer reporting reads only documented Herdr/Boomux/tmux identity variables; tmux inventory commands run only while tmux is already present, and Infomarchy never invokes Herdr or Boomux control APIs. Recent task text is credential-redacted before it reaches QML (token prefixes, `KEY=value` style assignments, authenticated URLs, PEM blocks, JWTs and common cloud key shapes — best effort, not a guarantee). Attention states come from terminal-title heuristics and are only evaluated while an agent is idle; a title that merely mentions "permission" or "failed" while it is still working does not raise a signal. Hover previews (off by default) capture the screen region the window occupies, so an occluded window previews whatever is drawn on top of it. Collector JSON is depth/node/byte bounded and streamed to QML in capped frames. Infomarchy has no screen-level privacy masking: prompts, projects, paths, host/network details, and session topics remain visible. The explicit `setDemo true` screenshot mode replaces the whole snapshot with documentation-only sample data and resets off whenever the shell restarts.

## FAQ

**Does it drain my battery?** One `bun` run every 4 s (~0.2 s of CPU warm), no idle animation except the busy-dot pulse — a few percent of one core at most. Raise `refreshMs` if you want it lower.

**The desk is black / empty.** You changed QML and the shell didn't reload the service — run `omarchy restart shell`. (`collector.ts` changes are picked up live.)

**Clicking a card doesn't focus anything.** The card says *no window* — the agent isn't under a Hyprland client (SSH session, systemd service, or started from a launcher that already exited). That's expected.

**Can I keep the stock wallpaper behaviour too?** Yes: disable `nixfred.infomarchy` and Omarchy restores `omarchy.background`. Or keep it enabled and set `wallpaperOpacity` to taste.

**Two monitors?** One desk per screen, each sized to its own resolution.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Per-card show/hide in the plugin settings schema (no QML editing)
- [ ] Task board from Claude Code `TaskCreate` / Codex goals, with completed-task history
- [ ] Fleet row: other hosts' AI load over SSH/Tailscale
- [ ] Memory / vector-store growth sparkline (qdrant, LMF, …)
- [ ] Theme gallery in this README — send yours

## Contributing

Issues and PRs welcome. The one rule: **nothing machine-specific** — if it needs your username, your path or your hostname, it needs to come from an env var or `/proc`. Adding a provider is a regex in `collector.ts` plus a colour/label in `InfoModel.qml`; please include a redacted sample of the data you're reading.

## Credits

Built on the [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org) shell by DHH and contributors, [Quickshell](https://quickshell.org), and [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org). The usage card stands on the shoulders of Omarchy's `omarchy.agents` widget.
